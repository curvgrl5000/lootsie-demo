        <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
        <p>Like most website operators, Lootsie collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
          that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, 
          referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Lootsie&#8217;s purpose in collecting 
          non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Lootsie&#8217;s visitors use its website. 
          From time to time, Lootsie may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., 
          by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
        </p>
        <p>Lootsie also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses 
          for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Lootsie.com blogs. Lootsie only discloses logged 
          in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying 
          information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the 
          administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
        </p>
        <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>Certain visitors to Lootsie&#8217;s websites choose to interact with Lootsie in ways that require Lootsie 
          to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Lootsie gathers depends
          on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at <a href="#">Lootsie.com</a>
          to provide a username and email address. Those who in engage in transaction with Lootsie gain access to the
          akismet comment spam prevention service, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary
          the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Lootsie collects such 
          information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&#8217;s interaction with Lootsie. 
          Lootsie does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always 
          refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain 
          website-related activities.
        </p>
        <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
        <p>Lootsie may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Lootsie may 
          monitor the most popular blogs on the CompanyDomain.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. 
          Lootsie may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Lootsie does not disclose 
          personally-identifying information other than as described below.
        </p>
        <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>Lootsie discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, 
          contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Lootsie&#8217;s behalf 
          or to provide services available at Lootsie&#8217;s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. 
          Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using 
          Lootsie&#8217;s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Lootsie will not rent or sell potentially
          personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated 
          organizations, as described above, Lootsie discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information 
          only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Lootsie believes in good faith that disclosure
          is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Lootsie, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered 
          user of an Lootsie website and have supplied your email address, Lootsie may occasionally send you an email to tell you about 
          new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&#8217;s going on with Lootsie and our products. We primarily 
          use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you 
          send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order 
          to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Lootsie takes all measures reasonably necessary 
          to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying     
          information.
        </p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&#8217;s computer, and that the visitor&#8217;s browser provides to the 
          website each time the visitor returns. Lootsie uses cookies to help Lootsie identify and track visitors, their usage of Lootsie 
          website, and their website access preferences. Lootsie visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set 
          their browsers to refuse cookies before using Lootsie&#8217;s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Lootsie&#8217;s websites 
          may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
        </p>
        <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>If Lootsie, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Lootsie goes out of business or enters
           bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers 
           may occur, and that any acquirer of Lootsie may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Ads</h3>
        <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the 
          ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use 
          your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of 
          most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Lootsie and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
        </p>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, 
          in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Lootsie may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Lootsie&#8217;s sole 
          discretion. Lootsie encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a 
          Lootsie.com account, you should also check your blog&#8217;s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site 
          after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
